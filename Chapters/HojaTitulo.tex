\textbf{\LARGE Abstract}\\

Any Colombian has probably heard a birdsongs at one time or another. In fact, Colombia is the country with the largest bird population in the world playing an important role in the conservation of bird, since the  richness of bird in an ecosystem will give information about the loss biodiversity and the sustainable of the ecosystem. As a physicist, I have been interested in how to use physical models to generate realistic data, especially in acoustic physics. I have studied how to simulate the production of sound by means of the means of the acoustics of musical instruments and the sound production of birds. However, musical acoustics are widely researched, as well the classification and identification of birds using their birdsongs, but the production of birdsongs is another matter. The best and most complete physical model that explains the production of sound in birds is the \textbf{motor gestures}\cite{simple_motor_gestures_2001} model, developed two decades ago i the Dynamical Systems Lab by professor G. Mindlin, which uses nonlinear ordinary differential equations to model  the organs involved in the production of sound in birds: \textbf{syrinx}\footnote{Main character for the sound production. A tissue that vibrates causing the air oscillates and modulate a sound pressure input to the trachea}, trachea, glottis, oro-oesophageal cavity (OEC), and beak. For his purpose, a control problem of two parameters, air sac pressure from the bird bronchi and labial tension, is formulated such that it generates a synthetic sample from simple paths of the parameters space and recorded birdsongs.\\

The present work designs, develops and evaluates a python packing for the motor gestures model. Using current tools of signal processing, numerical optimization, and object programming oriented, the model is successfully implemented making it fast of reproduce and easier develop. With the presented model implementation, the sound production of birds can be broadly studied: the parameters space and their impact on the synthetic birdsong. This implementation makes it possible to create several samples of synthetic birdsongs, with a few python command lines, and compare them through their spectral characteristics. Teherefore, the model allows us to create as many not complex birdsongs, with a fundamental frequency well defined, as we want and by modifying the path in the space parameters (motor gesture). In addition, future applications will allow us to identify and classify the bird by its motor gesture. \\

The performance of the model is evaluated mainly with the birdsong syllables of the colored sparrow (zonotrichia capensis or copeton), since this is a familiar bird in Colombia, and its generalization is tested with other oscine birds\footnotemark{bird in the Passeri suborder are called oscines or birdsongs}: Mimus gilvus, Euphonia laniirostris, and Rhinocryptidae. The results show that the model generates comparable birdsong syllables when the input audio is of high sound quality, low nose level, and the pitch is well computed. in other cases the model does not generate a comparable birdsong and may give a diverse birdsong. \\
